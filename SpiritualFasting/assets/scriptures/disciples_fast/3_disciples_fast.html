<h2>Renounce Counterfeit Control</h2>

<p>
This step requires for us to think or the biblical concept would call it "to discern."
</p> 

<p>
<b>2 Corinthians 11:3 (KJV)</b><br/>  
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
<br/><br/>

<b>2 Corinthians 11:3 (The Message)</b><br/>  
And now I'm afraid that exactly as the Snake seduced Eve with his smooth patter, you are being lured away form the simple purity of your love for Christ.
<br/><br/>

<b>2 Corinthians 11:3  (NASB)</b><br/>  
But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ.
<br/>
</p>

<p>
Take into consideration also the godless influence of the mass media in books, music, movies, and other forms of media and one immediately realizes that the work of the serpent is alive and well.  To experience this abundant life that Jesus promised, we have to understand the outside influences and their harm to us spiritually.  
Look at your life overall and ask God for a sense of spiritual and biblical discernment so that you can take effective inventory and renounce the control of the "counterfeit."  Embrace what is real and what is vibrant so that you can have spiritual victory.
