<h2>Submit to God's Authority</h2>

The fourth step to breakthrough in the Disciple's Fast involves overcoming rebellion by submitting to the authority of God and those He has placed over you.  Jesus compared being under authority to a manifestation of great faith (Matthew 8:8-10).
	God has placed all men under authority:

<ul>
<li><b>Civil Government</b>: Romans 13:1-7</li>
<li><b>Church Leadership</b>: Hebrews 13:17</li>
<li><b>Parents</b>: Ephesians 6:1-3</li>
<li><b>Husbands</b>: 1 Peter 3:1-4</li>
<li><b>Employers</b>: 1 Peter 2:13-23</li>
<li><b>God</b>: Daniel 9:5-9</li>
</ul>
