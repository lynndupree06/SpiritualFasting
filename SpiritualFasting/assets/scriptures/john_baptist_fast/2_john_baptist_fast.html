<h2>Extending Our Testimonies</h2>

<div>
Christians are commanded to be testimonies to others: "you are the light of the world" (Matt. 5:14). The John the Baptist Fast is a tool for believers to use to extend their lights. This fast is an important way to extend a faithful testimony even in a bad situation.<br/><br/>
Christians have a double obligation: (1) to live godly and (2) to actively extend their influence for the glory of God. "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven" (Matt. 5:16).<br/><br/>

Peter describes the problem and the solution: "Having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed" (I Pet. 3:16).
