<h2>Extending Our "Righteousness"</h2>

<div>
The John the Baptist Fast is for those who want to be good influences, or for those who have not had good testimonies, but want to be influential for God. Isaiah promised, "Is not this the fast that I have chosen for you... that your righteousness shall go before you" (Isaiah 58:6,8).<br/><br/>
This means that the believer's "righteousness" or testimony will extend beyond physical limitations. The John the Baptist fast enables us to ask God to reach those who know about us so our "righteousness" may have greater influence.
