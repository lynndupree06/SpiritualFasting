<h2>Extending What We Do Not Have</h2>

<div>
In one sense we cannot refer to our righteousness because the Bible says, "There is none righteous" (Romans 3:10). Before we are born again, we are sinners, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).<br/><br/> 

When we are born again we receive a double blessing. First, our sins are forgiven; second, the righteousness of Jesus Christ is given to us. "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin" (I John 1:7).
