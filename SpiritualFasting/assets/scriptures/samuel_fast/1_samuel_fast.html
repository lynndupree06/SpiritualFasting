<h3>Call the Body Together</h3>

<p>
1 Samuel 7:5 KJV  And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for 
you unto the LORD.

The results of individual and corporate fasting are distinctly different from each other.  
When a person embarks on a fast, he is submitting himself individually to God.  
Corporate fasting makes a person responsible for what God does for the entire Church.  
When a Church comes together to fast or when a small group may come together to fast, 
then God will answer the corporate prayer and fasting effort.
	 

Galatians 6:2 KJV  Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

Romans 15:1 KJV  We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
