<h3>Demonstrate True Repentance</h3>

<p>
1 Samuel 7:2 KJV  And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, 
that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented 
after the LORD.

The glory had departed twenty years ago and now the culmination of all of the trouble 
had finally caused them to really take notice of their situation.  So much water under 
the bridge had been bitter water.  Their entire nation was feeling the effects of their 
godless ways.  Yet, there is a great lesson that is illustrated here:  Repentance is far 
more than tears and loud lamentations.  Real repentance will always have some action 
with it.  This principle is illustrated in the very next verse in this setting.

1 Samuel 7:3 KJV  And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do 
return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth 
from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will 
deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

True repentance requires that some things be Òput away.Ó  

The New Living Translation  --  ÒGet rid of your foreign gods.Ó
Knox  --  ÒRid yourselves of all alien gods.Ó
The Message  --  ÒGet rid of the foreign gods and fertility goddesses, ground yourselves firmly in God.Ó

Proverbs 1:23-33 KJV  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, 
I will make known my words unto you.  [24]  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have 
stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;  [25]  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, 
and would none of my reproof:  [26]  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when 
your fear cometh;  [27]  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh 
as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.  [28]  Then shall they call upon 
me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:  [29]  
For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:  [30]  They would 
none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.  [31]  Therefore shall they eat of the 
fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.  [32]  For the turning away 
of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.  [33]  But 
whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

True repentance always has positive results.
