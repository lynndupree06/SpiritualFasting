<h3>Psalms 139:23-24 (KJV)</h3>  

<p>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:  
[24]  And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
</p>

<h3>Separate from Secret Sin</h3>

<p>
When the Church comes together and begins to repent, the Spirit of the Lord will search 
us for secret sins.  We live in an age where everything revolves around image and very 
little emphasis is placed on character.  If the image fits, then society generally has 
very little concern with the depth of character.  This is the principle of the clean cup 
that Jesus mentioned to the Pharisees in Matthew 23:25-26.  The cup and saucer was clean 
on the outside but was very soiled on the inside. <br/><br/> 

Four thoughts come from this portion of the fast:

<ul>
<li>Backsliders are blinded to sin in their lives.  They are generally willfully ignorant of an obligation to God.</li>
<li>Backsliders are careless about sin in their lives.  The fact that a person may have "gotten away" with some of their sin will provide more confidence to take more steps away from God.</li>
<li>During fasting, God can show hidden sin to the believer; a sin that very well could be prohibiting God's blessings.</li>  
<li>More adjustments that we need to take are revealed as we continue the Samuel Fast.  Fasting has to be an ongoing process, meaning that we have to have a consistent level of fasting weekly or at least monthly.</li>
</ul>
