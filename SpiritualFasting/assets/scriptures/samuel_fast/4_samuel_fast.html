<h3>Have Corporate Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>
There are some who hold the view that there is no such thing as corporate sin.  
They hold that sin is something that is done on an individual basis.  While that view is 
certainly valid, Scripturally there are several examples where one notes that sin was 
confessed for the group as a whole.  

Numbers 14:40 KJV  And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.  (For hesitation about going into the Promised Land.)

Numbers 21:7 KJV  Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.  (For murmuring against Moses and Lord.  Fiery serpents were sent to punish them.)
Jeremiah 14:7 KJV  O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.  (For their numerous backslidings over the course of time.)
Daniel 9:5 KJV  We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:

Note the following reference:

1 Samuel 7:6 KJV  And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.

	The nation of Israel as a whole was speaking very clearly that “we have sinned” and need the power of God to help us to overcome the breach in the gap.  Even Nehemiah had to offer up the words of repentance because of the breached walls and torn-down Temple.
	If you have been lethargic, spiritually cold, harboring secret sin, not responding to the preached Word, resistant to spiritual leadership, criticizing the church (both members and leaders), prayer-less, and full of carnality, it does not just effect you, it effects the entire church.  That is why during the Samuel Fast, when we are coming together to fast for revival that these issues are important to be overcome.
