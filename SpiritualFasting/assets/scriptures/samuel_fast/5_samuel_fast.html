<h3>1 Samuel 7:3 (KJV)</h3>  

<p>And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the 
LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, 
and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out 
of the hand of the Philistines.</p>


<h3>Acknowledge the Power of the Word</h3>

<p>
No revival has ever occurred without the involvement of the Word of God.  
During the early years of Samuel's life, the Word of God was "precious" (l Samuel 3:1).  
The underlying definition of this word is that it was very rare.  

<ul>
<li>Under Jacob:  Genesis 35:1-4.  Jacob commanded that the false gods and idols be put away.  They were told to wash and change their garments and while they were doing these things Jacob was building an altar.</li>
<li>Under Samuel:  1 Samuel 7:3-6.  Samuel urged the putting away of false gods and for the heart to be prepared to receive the work of the Spirit.</li>
<li>Under Moses:  Exodus 14:31-15:21.  Revival began to make its way into the children of Israel's lives when the complainers turned into worshipers.  They saw the mighty hand of God destroy the armies of Pharoah in the Red Sea.  On the other side of the sea, revival broke out.</li>
<li>Under David:  1 Chronicles 15:25-28; 16:1-43; 29:10-25.  This first revival took place when the Ark was returned from the Philistines and brought into Jerusalem for the very first time.  1 Chronicles 29.  This is the second great revival that came when the materials for the Temple were being gathered for Solomon to construct.</li>
<li>Numerous others are noted:  Solomon (1 Kings 6-8); Asa (l Kings 15:11-15); Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 19); Elijah (1 Kings 18:21-40); Jehu (2 Kings 10:15-28); Jehoiada (2 Kings 11:17-20); Hezekiah (2 Chronicles 29-31); Manasseh (2 Chronicles 33:11-20); Josiah (2 Kings 22-23); Ezra (Ezra 9-10); Nehemiah (Neh. 13); Jonah (Jonah 3); Esther (Est. 9:17-22); John the Baptist (Luke 3:2-18); Jesus (John 4:28-42); Philip (Acts 8:5-12); Peter (Acts 2 and 9); Paul (Acts 19:11-20).</li>
</ul>
