<h3>Get In Touch With the Symbols of the Sacred</h3>

<p>
<b><u>The symbols:</u></b><br/>

<ol>
<li><b>Fasting from Food:</b>  The outer demonstration of fasting can reflect the inner desire 
of the heart.</li>
<li><b>Sacrificing to God:</b>  Two offerings are made by Samuel in this fast.  The first 
was a blood sacrifice (1 Samuel 7:6) offered by Samuel.  The second was a sacrifice 
that was made by the people.  They took water and poured it out on the ground.</li>
</ol> 

<ul>
<li>Ask forgiveness from someone.</li>
<li>Get involved in some form of service.</li>
<li>Shore up your efforts at consistently attending the house of God.</li>
<li>Commit long passages of Scripture to your memory.</li>
<li>Make some form of restitution to someone (to those you may have hurt) or restore some thing (to those whom you may have taken something from).</li>
<li>Spend time at church alone with God.</li>
<li>Witness to someone with the intent of teaching a home Bible study to.</li>
<li>Get involved in consistently mentoring someone younger than you who needs your assistance.</li>
<li>Begin tithing and offering to God what He has given to you.</li>
</ul>

As we invest our efforts in activities like those just mentioned, you will be able to find 
that there are points of victory in your life and in the Church.<br/><br/>

While the children of Israel were involved in the sacrifice, the process of victory 
started with a "great thunder."

One must understand that this was not the last battle Israel would have with Philistines, 
but on this day, God took notice of their return to Him and went and fought the battle.   
Victories like this can cause us to look into the past, look at the present, and look into 
the future.
