And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew 
near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon 
the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.</p>

Victories like this can cause us to look into the past, look at the present, and look into 
the future.
