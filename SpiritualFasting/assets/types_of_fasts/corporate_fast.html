Corporate fasting is a time when a group of believers join in fasting and prayer. This 
group may be a family, such as when Esther told her uncle to fast and pray, or may be a 
group from a church or churches. In fact, it can incorporate any group of believers even 
if they are separated by miles. This fasting is most often connected with specific prayer 
requests.
