The Daniel Fast is a biblically based partial fast. 
The idea behind this fast is taken from two anchoring scriptures in the Old Testament.<br/><br/> 
In Daniel 1:8-14, a young man by the name of Daniel is a 
captive in Babylon where he is taught Babylonian customs and prepared to serve in 
the court. Daniel and his closest friends turn down the king's diet of wine and 
rich foods and Daniel speaks with the chief official about an alternative diet. 
The official is concerned the health of Daniel and his friends will suffer if they 
eat nothing but vegetables (that would have included fruits) and water, but Daniel talks him into a ten-day trial 
period. At the end of the ten days, Daniel and his friends look healthier than 
those eating the king's diet.
So from this scripture we get two guidelines for the fast:
<ul>
<li>Only fruits and vegetables</li>
<li>Only water for a beverage</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Then in Daniel 10 we read that the Prophet ate no meat nor any precious breads or 
foods and he drank no wine for 21 days. So from this scripture, we get a third guideline:
<ul>
<li>No sweeteners and no breads</li>
</ul>
Another important guideline is drawn from Jewish fasting principles, where no 
leaven is used during the fast. So that’s why yeast, baking powder and the like are 
not allowed on the Daniel Fast.<br/><br/>

Finally, with all the above puzzle pieces, we conclude that no artificial or
processed foods nor any chemicals are allowed on the Daniel Fast.
