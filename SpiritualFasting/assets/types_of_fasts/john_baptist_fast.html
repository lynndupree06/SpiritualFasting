John the Baptist lived life in the wilderness and ate a limited diet of locusts and wild 
honey. While that isn't going to be the diet of choice for most people today, this fast 
represents separation from the world. The John the Baptist Fast is a 6 day fast for those who want to 
extend their light and be a good influence on those around them.
