The Disciples Fast was a fast that was focused more inwardly on one's personal 
walk with God and overcoming strongholds in their lives.  The Samuel Fast turns 
outward and involves itself with the restoration, renewal, and revival of the church.
When we begin to think about revival there are several things that are understood 
about revival:

<ul>
<li>Revival is not an automatic experience.  It is something to be desired and prayed for.</li>
<li>God is the source of all real revival and it comes only from His presence.</li>
<li>Revival has a way of bring back refreshing results to a church and to our personal lives.</li>
<li>Revival will bring a powerful sense of awe in our lives for God.</li>
<li>Revival restores a love for holiness.</li>
<li>Revival gives us a great conviction for sin.</li>
<li>Revival restores a great fervor in prayer.</li>
<li>Revival facilitates both spiritual and numerical growth in churches.</li>
<li>Revival breaks the power of the world and the squeeze of sin on the lives of saints.</li>
</ul>
	
Isaiah 58:6 indicates that there is a fast that will allow the "oppressed" to go free.  
The word can also be understood as "broken."  Our society is filled to capacity with 
those who are broken in spirit and bound and held hostage by sin.
