Two different fasting methods are considered radical fasting. The first is when no food 
or water are taken, like Jesus did when he fasted in the wilderness. The second form of 
radical fasting allows water but nothing else. You can find a number of biblical examples 
of radical fasting. Here are a few:

<ul>
	<li>David (2 Samuel 12:15-20)</li>
	<li>Esther and her family (Esther 4:15-16)</li>
	<li>Moses (Deuteronomy 9:9-18)</li>
	<li>Jesus (Matthew 4:1-11)</li>
</ul>
