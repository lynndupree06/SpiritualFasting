<p>
The purpose of this fast is "To let the oppressed go free" (Isaiah 58:6); for revival and soul winning,
to identify with people everywhere enslaved by sin.<br/><br/>

The key verse is 1 Samuel 7:6 "And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and 
poured [it] out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned 
against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah."<br/><br/> 

Samuel led the fast to bring the Ark of the Covenant back in and prayed that Isreal 
would be delivered from the sin that allowed the Ark to be captured.
