The Samuel Fast is found in 2 Samuel and it tells of the account of Samuel instructing the 
Israelites to separate themselves from the world. They had drifted far from God's will 
and were persecuted by the Philistines. Along with getting rid of the false gods, Samuel 
told them to fast and pray. This is really another example of corporate fasting.
