The Bible gives examples of God's people occasionally combining fasting with their prayers 
so as to stir up their zeal and renew their dedication and commitment to Him. King David 
wrote that he "humbled [him]self with fasting" (Psalm 35:13). Fasting is a means of getting 
our minds back on the reality that we are not self-sufficient. Fasting helps us realize just 
how fragile we are and how much we depend on things beyond ourselves.<br/><br/>

The Bible records that great men of faith such as Moses, Elijah, Daniel, Paul and Jesus 
Himself fasted so that they might draw closer to God (Exodus 34:28; 1 Kings 19:8; Daniel 9:3; 
Daniel 10:2-3; 2 Corinthians 11:27; Matthew 4:2). Jesus knew that His true disciples, once 
He was no longer there in the flesh with them, at times would need to fast to regain and 
renew their zeal to serve Him (Mark 2:18-20).<br/><br/>

James tells us, "Draw near to God and He will draw near to you" (James 4:8). Constant prayer 
and occasional fasting help us to do this.<br/><br/>

We are not to fast to have people feel sorry for us or to think we're pious (Matthew 6:16-18).
Isaiah 58 gives both bad and good examples of fasting, contrasting wrong attitudes and actions
(verses 3-5) with the right approach of outgoing love (Isaiah 58:6-10). Daniel and Nehemiah 
set the example of having a repentant frame of mind (Daniel 9:3-4; Nehemiah 9:1-2).<br/><br/>

Fasting also helps us learn the lessons of the Day of Atonement: forgiveness, reconciliation 
to God and the need to resist Satan and pray for the time of his removal (Revelation 20:1-3), 
which was portrayed in type by the Azazel goat on Atonement (Leviticus 16:20-22).<br/><br/>

<h1>Facts</h1>

<ul>

<li>
Fasting was an expected discipline in both the Old and New Testament eras. For example, 
Moses fasted at least two recorded forty-day periods. Jesus fasted 40 days and reminded 
His followers to fast, "when you fast," not if you fast.
</li>

<li>
Fasting and prayer can restore the loss of the "first love" for your Lord and result in a 
more intimate relationship with Christ.
Fasting is a biblical way to truly humble yourself in the sight of God (Psalm 35:13; Ezra 
8:21). King David said, "I humble myself through fasting."
Fasting enables the Holy Spirit to reveal your true spiritual condition, resulting in 
brokenness, repentance, and a transformed life.
The Holy Spirit will quicken the Word of God in your heart and His truth will become more 
meaningful to you!
Fasting can transform your prayer life into a richer and more personal experience.
</li>
</ul>

Fasting can result in a dynamic personal revival in your own life-and make you a channel 
of revival to others.
Fasting and prayer are the only disciplines that fulfill the requirements of II Chronicles 
7:14:<br/><br/>

<i>"If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face 
and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin 
and will heal their land."</i><br/><br/>

If you fast, you will find yourself being humbled. You will discover more time to 
pray and seek God's face. And as He leads you to recognize and repent of unconfessed sin,
 you will experience special blessings from God.
